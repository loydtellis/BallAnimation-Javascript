HORIZONTAL BALL ANIMATION.

The HTML page (ballAnimationCounter.html) is purely based on javascript, where the animation is about a ball that moves horizontally and bounces back on hitting the window wall.

Following are some of the features of the animation:

-On the first click of ball, the ball starts moving.
-On the ODD counter that is the first click, a counter will be started and the ball starts moving. On the second click, the ball stops moving. Followed by the third click where the counter increases to +1 and starts moving, and so on.
